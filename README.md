The application gives the user a Facebook experience and in addition provides two new features:

1. A dating feature that allows the user to find friends who match his interests. The system allows the user to select preferences such as gender and age. The system checks with the user's friends if the friend has potential in terms of gender, age range and if he/she is available for a relationship. (Relationship status can be as: open relationship, divorced, widowed, single).
If the system finds such members, it displays them in a designed list for suitable potential members. The user can select a member from the list so the profile picture of the member will be displayed, according to the user's preferences.
In addition, the user has the option to look through his friend's photo album, thus getting to know his friend better.

2. A feature that focuses on the popularity of all the posts that the user has published in order to inform the user when is the optimal time for him to publish the contents of his affairs.
The system analyzes calculations for each post as a function of the number of likes and comments from the user's acquaintances, in order to achieve accurate results in terms of time to publish the post - day and hour of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night, dawn).
The system calculates the score for each post according to the parameters mentioned above, and in addition takes into account external factors such as: comment = 3 likes.
The purpose of the system is to expand the social media influence of that user and help him reach new audiences, thus uniting new users with his/her current following audience.
