In addition, the user has the option to look at the photos of the friend from his album, thus getting to know his friend better.

2.A feature that focuses on the popularity of all the posts that the user has published in order to inform the user when the optimal time for him to publish the contents of his affairs.
The system analyzes calculations for each post as a function of the number of likes and comments from the user's acquaintances, in order to achieve accurate results in terms of time to publish the post - day and hour of the day (morning, afternoon, afternoon, evening, night, towards morning).
The system calculates the score for each post according to the parameters mentioned above, and in addition takes into account external factors such as: comment = 3 likes.
The purpose of the system is to expand the Internet influence of that user and help him reach more new audiences, thus uniting new users who will be added to his followers audience.
